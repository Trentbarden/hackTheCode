# hackTheCode
My first personal project

This is my first Personal Project for C++. It is a simple game designed to take an input from the user in an attempt to crack to code and save the world. The game is designed to be deceptive and always result in catastrophe no matter what user intends, unless it is the specific saveTheWorld passcode.
